# Snack-Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a retro-style interface with background music for an engaging experience. The goal is to control the snake and eat the food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control the snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
- **Background Music:** Background music plays during the game for an immersive experience.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks the playerâ€™s score based on how much food the snake eats.
- **Game Over Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Responsive Design:** The game works on different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, interactions, and sound control.

## How It Works

1. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
2. The snake moves continuously in the selected direction.
3. The goal is to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.
4. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
6. Background music enhances the gaming experience and can be controlled or muted.
